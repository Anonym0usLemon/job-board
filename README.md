# Project Name: Job Board
## Description: 
A job listing website where users can view job ads, post job ads, and apply for jobs. 

## Configuration Notes: 
Developed Locally on XAMPP, Appache server configurations were changed.
Document root in httpd.conf was set to ```/project_name/public``` so that Appache looks for the index in the public folder when you go to localhost in your browser. The directory in httpd.conf was also set as this value.

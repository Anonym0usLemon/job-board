# Project Name: Workopia
## Description: 
A job listing website where users can view job ads, post job ads, and apply for jobs. 

## Notes: 
Developed Locally on XAMPP, Appache server configureations were changed.
Document root in httpd.conf was set to ```/project_name/public``` so that the Appache looks for the index in the public folder when you go to localhost in your browser.
